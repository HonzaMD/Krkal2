KRKAL 2

ABOUT THE PRODUCT
=================

   Krkal is a puzzle action top-down game. You control one of three
characters and try to find your way through a maze, which is full of 
various traps and obstacles. 
   You will need quick fingers, as well as a sharp mind, since in later
levels the game gets hard!
Levels are built from many (50!) various elements and objects, which
influence each other, and you as well. You will move stones, slide on ice,
avoid mines, properly set various switches, wonder through mazes and maybe
rearrange signs for traffic monsters...
   Our inspirations were games such as Robbo, Boulder Dash (Supaplex),
or Sokoban, and despite this Krkal looks different; in each level you can
expect something new, original. You see everything clearly from
an overhead view and the game also offers quality graphics and music.
Important part is also a level editor.
   Krkal 2 was created in the game engine of the same name in 2004.
Engine was created as a project at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics
Charles University and was further developed as a diploma thesis at
the same place. The original Krkal 1 is from 1997 and this version 2.5
is created on 20th anniversary of Krkal - 2017.

KRKAL CONTROLS
==============

 # character movement: arrow keys 
You can move in four basic directions only – you cannot move diagonally.
You may hold more arrow keys at once, in which case you will move in one
of the directions available at the moment, the last pressed key is
preferred. This is a priceless quality in various mazes.
 # switching between characters: TAB
in some levels you have multiple characters, sometimes it is possible to
switch between the characters, other times they are all controlled at once
(when then for example you press right arrow - all characters will
move right) 
 # using a bomb: Z 
 # using a mine: X 
 # pick up a traffic sign: A 
 # placing (and/or turning) a directional sign: 1+directional key 
 # placing do not enter: 2 
 # placing sixty: 3 
 # placing end of sixty: 4 
 # back to the main menu: Esc

   A player character can collect certain items. A maximum of 12 pieces
of each item is allowed. Most items get picked up automatically, as soon
as the character enters the cell. With these items it is not possible to
decide whether you want them or not. An exception are signs, they are
collected using a special key 'A'. 
   The collected items cannot be disposed of without a reason. Some items
can be used with a special key (see above). Other items are used
automatically - e.g. key is used always, when a player wants to enter
a cell which a lock. Here I want to point out one sneaky thing - if
a player has a key and some force makes him enter (e.g. sliding on ice)
a cell with the lock - then the lock will always unlock, whether the player
wishes it or not.
