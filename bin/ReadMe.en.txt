ABOUT THE PRODUCT
=================

KRKAL is a sophisticated system for 2D games design and development. 
With KRKAL you can develop the brand new games or just improve games 
already existing. You can create or modify game levels and play all 
games, of course.
KRKAL includes a full logical-action game Krkal, which is a remake of 
the excellent logical-action title. KRKAL runs on a powerful graphics 
engine, it has its own level editor, script editor and compiler. KRKAL 
was originally developed at the Faculty of Math and Physics of the 
Charles University, Prague, the Czech Republic.


Game Krkal

Krkal is an excellent logical-action game. With one of three different 
characters, you have to avoid all dangerous traps, deal with various 
items, escape from deadly monsters and in the first place – boil your 
brain – to finally find the way through and reach so long desired exit... 
and then? Just select level that is even more difficult and rush to 
the battle again.

The levels are built of many miscellaneous items, which interact one with 
the other. You will push stones, slide on the ice, avoid stepping on 
mines, play with the switches, wander in complex labyrinths and even 
set up the traffic signs to take advantage of the traffic monsters!

Simply, Krkal is very interesting and unique. You observe everything 
from above and will miss neither a professional graphics nor stylish 
music. With KRKAL, you will not only be able to build new levels from 
existing items, but also create quite new objects. You will be able to 
improve and modify the game itself!

GAME KRKAL: CONTROLS
====================

#  movement: key arrows
-  You can move in four basic directions only – you cannot move diagonally.
-  You may hold more arrow keys at once, in which case you will move 
     in one of the directions available at the moment. This is very 
     useful in the labyrinths.
#  switching between the characters: TAB
-  In some levels, you can control more than one character.
-  Sometimes you control only one character at the moment and may switch 
     between them, while sometimes you control them all together. In this 
     case, if you for example press the right arrow key, all the 
     characters will start moving right.
#  drop the bomb: Z
#  put down the mine: X
#  pick up the traffic sign: A
#  put down the direction sign: 1 + direction arrow 
     (you may also change the direction of a lying sign)
#  put down the no fare sign: 2
#  put down the 60 km/h speed limit sign: 3
#  put down the end of the 60 km/h speed limit sign: 4

You can pick up some items and collect them in your inventory. You may 
collect up to 12 items of each type. Most of these items are picked up 
automatically as you step on the cell they are located. You cannot decide 
whether to pick up such item or not. The traffic signs are exception, you 
can choose to pick a sign by pressing ‘A’ key. Once picked up, the items 
cannot be discarded, but you can use some of them (as described above). 
Some items are used automatically – for instance, the key is used after 
you have tried to step on the cell blocked by the lock. Here we would 
like to warn of one captious feature: If you have a key and you are forced 
to move towards the lock (usually on the ice), you will unlock it when 
either you want or not.
